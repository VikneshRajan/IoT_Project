# Smart Home Automation

In this project, we have implemented an App that was developed in Flutter to serve our purpose of making a Smart Home Automation. The circuit links for the Temperature Monitoring Circuit and Home Automation Circuit are Given below

- [Temperature Monitoring Circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kWh3fe1qmO3-temperature-control/editel?sharecode=mQOH5_830OHEXxL0RrH566xjuNAMSPKgv_JmnkRvMg0)
- [Home Automation Circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cZCvi4dg8gf-smart-home-solution/editel?sharecode=owRpARBzU0thA0SL1sZldnMSMi26yu8gD2qPSiMdXMA)

We are using Flutter app to control the appliances connected in our smart home eco-system. For cross platform communication we are making use of the [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) cloud API.

Log in to ThingSpeak and create a channel, Enter the Channel ID and API key on the field specified on the Temperature Monitoring Circuit's code.
